# Vitor Health — Mobile Diagnostics & Preventive Health Platform (2020–2021)

## Public Context

Vitor Healthsciences is a Bengaluru-based healthcare solutions company focused on preventive health risk assessment and rapid diagnostic screening. The company operates in the “not-yet-sick” segment, enabling early detection of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, and respiratory conditions.

Vitor’s model combines portable diagnostic devices with instant, on-site reporting, allowing screenings to be conducted at workplaces, community locations, and homes without dependence on traditional lab infrastructure. The platform has been used by enterprises, NGOs, and government bodies, particularly during COVID-19, to deliver scalable, compliant health screening programs.

## Product Overview

Vitor Health built a mobile-first diagnostics platform that integrated portable medical devices with a unified application layer for test execution, result capture, and reporting.

This was an operations-heavy, compliance-driven product, designed for real-world field conditions where reliability, accuracy, and turnaround time mattered more than consumer UX polish.

The system supported 50+ diagnostic tests and enabled instant reporting across varied deployment contexts.
